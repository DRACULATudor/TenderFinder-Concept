# TenderFinder (Concept)

TenderFinder is an application that provides the latest tenders from Switzerland. This repository contains the concept and implementation of a tender-aggregation application enhanced with a smart search engine and email matching for tenders to help users find relevant opportunities quickly.

> NOTE: This README is a starting point—update commands, environment variables and examples to match your actual implementation.

---
## Features

- Aggregates the latest public tenders from Swiss sources.
- Smart search engine to better match tenders to user queries (full-text, synonyms, weighting, filters).
- Email notifications for users when new tenders match their saved searches.
- Lightweight API to search and fetch tender details.
- Background worker to poll sources, index tenders, and send notifications.

## Tech Stack

Predominantly JavaScript (Node.js) with some Python utilities (for scraping or NLP tasks) and other supporting files.

- Backend: Node.js (Express / Fastify or similar)
- Search: Elastic/Lunr/Meilisearch/Typesense (or local inverted-index implementation)
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / SQLite (adapt to your choice)
- Email: SMTP (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, Postfix) or direct SMTP
- Scrapers/parsers: JavaScript and optional Python utilities for complex parsing
- Scheduler: cron / node-cron / worker queue (Bull, Bee-Queue)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (or version used in your repo)
- npm or yarn
- A running database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Search engine if using an external index (Meilisearch, Elastic, Typesense) - optional
- SMTP credentials for sending emails

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo

   git clone https://github.com/DRACULATudor/TenderFinder-Concept.git
   cd TenderFinder-Concept

2. Install dependencies

   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

3. Create a `.env` file and fill in required variables.

4. Run database migrations / seeders (if applicable)

   npm run migrate
   npm run seed

5. Start the application (development)

   npm run dev
   # or production
   npm start

Notes: Replace the commands above with the actual scripts in your package.json (e.g., start, dev, migrate). If your repo uses pnpm or different script names, adapt accordingly.


## How It Works

High-level flow:

1. Scraper / fetcher polls configured tender sources (websites, APIs) on a schedule.
2. Newly discovered tenders are normalized and stored in the database.
3. Tenders are indexed into the search engine (internal or external) to support fast queries and advanced ranking.
4. Users create search subscriptions (saved queries / filters).
5. A background job compares new tenders against subscriptions and queues emails for matching subscribers.
6. Email notifications are sent via configured SMTP provider.

Background jobs can be implemented using node-cron, Agenda, or a queue like Bull for reliability and retries.


## Smart Search Notes

The smart search can include:
- Tokenization, stemming/lemmatization (language-specific for German/French/Italian).
- Synonym expansion (e.g., "construction" ⇄ "bau").
- Field boosting (title, summary, issuer).
- Date and proximity filters.
- Fuzzy matching and typo tolerance.

## Email Notifications

- Subscriptions store user email, search criteria and preferred frequency.
- When new relevant tenders appear, the notifier creates a digest and sends it via SMTP.
- Support unsubscribe links and confirmations to comply with best practices and regulations (e.g., GDPR).

Implement retry and bounce handling depending on SMTP provider feedback.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/describe-feature
3. Make changes and add tests.
4. Push and open a pull request describing your changes.

Please follow the coding style used in the repo, add tests for new features, and document any configuration changes.

## Roadmap / Ideas

- Multi-language NLP improvements (DE/FR/IT)
- Public web UI with user accounts and saved searches
- Advanced ranking and relevance feedback loop
- Role-based access for organization accounts
- CSV / Excel export for tenders
- Mobile push notifications
